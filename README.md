# Junitex-Builder

### Installation

Junitex-Builder provides Latex to Unicode tab completions for the Julia language in Gnome-Builder. Custom plugins in Gnome-Builder are only available for versions >= 3.20. If you're running Gnome-Builder with an appropriate version clone the repository in to your plugins folder

```
>> cd ~/.local/share/gnome-builder/plugins
>> git clone https://github.com/nsmith5/Junitex-Builder.git
```

### Limitation

Currently, Junitex can not tab complete superscript or subscript unicode characters for some reason. Otherwise everything else works
